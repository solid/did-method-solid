Preface
        </h2>
        <p>
The Solid DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the
Decentralized Identifiers v1.0 Specification [[DID-CORE]]. For more
information about DIDs and DID method specifications, please also see the
DID Primer [[?DID-PRIMER]].
        </p>
        <p>
The DID method operations are designed to be compatible with existing Solid
servers. For more information, see Solid Protocol [[SOLID-PROTOCOL]].
        </p>
        <p class="issue" title="Name of this DID method">
The Solid DID method specification is a specialisation of the Web DID method
[[DID-WEB]] whereby write (create, update, delete) operations are more tightly
specified. The Solid DID method is designed to be generic enough to be compatible
with other Web-based systems which implement read and write operations using
HTTP verbs. For this reason, we are considering whether to name the DID method
<code>did:https</code> or <code>did:rest</code> or similar.

        <h2>
Verifiable data registry
        </h2>
        <p>
The verifiable data registry of the Solid DID method is the web host that the domain
name described by the DID resolves to when queried through the Domain Name System
(DNS). This MAY be a Solid <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol#data-pod">data
pod</a> [[SOLID-PROTOCOL]].

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>
Method name
        </h2>
        <p>
The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>solid</code>.
A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
<code>did:solid</code>. This string MUST be in lowercase.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>
Method-specific identifier
        </h2>
        <p>
The method specific identifier is a fully qualified domain name that is
secured by a TLS/SSL certificate with an optional path to the DID document.
The formal rules describing valid domain name syntax are described in
[[RFC1035]], [[RFC1123]], and [[RFC2181]].
        </p>
        <p>
The method specific identifier MUST match the common name used in the SSL/TLS
certificate, and it MUST NOT include IP addresses or port numbers. Directories
and subdirectories MAY optionally be included, delimited by colons rather
than slashes.
        </p>

        <h2>
Representation
        </h2>
        <p>
Solid DIDs use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#json-ld">JSON-LD
representation</a> for DID documents [[DID-CORE]].
        </p>
        <p>
The <code>@context</code> value MUST contain the Solid context URL
as the second entry in the list (following the DID Core context URL).
The Solid context URL is: <code>https://TODO-solid-context</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
The definition of the Solid DID JSON-LD context is:
        </p>

        <p class="issue" title="Solid context">
TODO
        </p>
        <p>
DID documents for Solid DIDs MAY contain any verification methods and
service endpoints as required by the DID controller.
        </p>
        <p>
All terms in the DID document MUST be present in either the DID Core
context or the Solid context.

        <h2>
Mapping a DID to an HTTP URL
        </h2>
        <p>
A prerequisite for the Solid DID method operations is to map the DID subject
URI to an HTTP URL. This is done as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Replace ":" with "/" in the method specific identifier to obtain the fully
qualified domain name and optional path.
          </li>
          <li>
Generate an HTTPS URL to the expected location of the DID document by
prepending <code>https://</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="issue" title="Location of DID doc">
Do we want to 'hardcode' a path for the actual DID document itself? Eg. A
final step in the above could be "append <code>/did</code> to the URL".
Otherwise we just rely on the content type and the server returns the DID doc
for the DID subject URI given the correct content type? Or do we use the
<code>type</code> Link header, as is done for containers?

          <h3>
Create (Register)
          </h3>
          <p>
To register a DID for the first time, the client MUST execute an HTTP
<code>PUT</code> request as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
Generate the URL by following the steps in <a href="#mapping-a-did-to-an-http-url"></a>.
            </li>
            <li>
Set the body of the HTTP request to the JSON-LD representation of the DID document
(see <a href="#representation"></a>).
            </li>
            <li>
Execute an HTTP <code>PUT</code> request to the URL with with a <code>Content-Type</code>
header with the value <code>application/did+ld+json</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
Upon receipt of a valid create request, the server MUST store the triples in the payload
of the request, and MUST respond with a <code>201</code> status code.

          <h3>
Read (Resolve)
          </h3>
          <p>
The following steps MUST be executed to resolve the DID document from a Solid
DID:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
Retreive the URL by following the steps in <a href="#mapping-a-did-to-an-http-url"></a>.
            </li>
            <li>
Perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> request to the URL using an agent that can
successfully negotiate a secure HTTPS connection, with an <code>Accept</code>
header with a value including <code>application/did+ld+json</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="issue" title="Content type">
The content type <code>application/did+ld+json</code> is at risk in the DID
Core specification [[DID-CORE]] so this requirement may change (most likely
to a content type of <code>application/ld+json</code> accompanied by a
specific <code>profile</code> value).
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>
Update
          </h3>
          <p>
To update the DID document, the client MUST perform the same steps as for
a create operation (see <a href="#create-register"></a>). The entire updated DID
document (not a diff) MUST be included in the request body.
          </p>
          <p>
Upon receipt of a valid update request, the server MUST replace the triples already
present for the DID document with the triples from the request payload. The server
MUST respond with a <code>200</code> or <code>204</code> status code.

          <h3>
Deactivate (Revoke)
          </h3>
          <p>
To delete the DID document, the client MUST retreive the URL by following the
steps in <a href="#mapping-a-did-to-an-http-url"></a>, and then MUST make an
HTTP <code>DELETE</code> request to the URL.
          </p>
          <p>
Upon receipt of such a <code>DELETE</code> request, the server MUST remove the
triples pertaining to the DID document, and return a <code>200</code> or
<code>204</code> status code. The server MUST respond with a <code>404</code>
or <code>410</code> status code for future requests to the URL.

          <p>
At least TLS 1.2 should be configured to use only strong ciphers suites and to
use sufficiently large key sizes. As recommendations may be volatile these days,
only the very latest recommendations should be used. However, as a rule of
thumb, the following must be used:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
Ephemeral keys are to be used.
            </li>
            <li>
ECDHE with one of the strong curves {X25519, brainpoolP384r1, NIST P-384,
brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} shall be used as key exchange.
            </li>
            <li>
AESGCM or ChaCha20 with 256 bit large keys shall be used for bulk encryption
            </li>
            <li>
ECDSA with one of the strong curves {brainpoolP384r1, NIST P-384,
brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} or RSA (at least 3072) shall be used.
            </li>
            <li>
Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) shall be used as Mac.
            </li>
            <li>
At least SHA256 shall be used, but SHA384 or POLY1305 are recommended.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
Examples of strong SSL/TLS configurations for now are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
<code>ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=ECDSA,
Enc=AESGCM(256), Mac=AEAD</code>
            </li>
            <li>
<code>ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=RSA Enc=AESGCM(256),
Mac=AEAD</code>
            </li>
            <li>
<code>ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=ECDSA,
Enc=ChaCha20-Poly1305, Mac=AEAD</code>
            </li>
            <li>
<code>ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=RSA,
Enc=ChaCha20-Poly1305, Mac=AEAD</code>
            </li>
            <li>
<code>ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=RSA,
Enc=AESGCM(256), Mac=AEAD</code>
            </li>
            <li>
<code>ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=ECDSA,
Enc=AESGCM(256), Mac=AEAD</code>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
It is recommended to adhere to OWASP's Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet
[[OWASP-TRANSPORT]] latest recommendations for hardening TLS configurations.
          </p>

          <p>
Delete action can be performed by domain name registrars or DNS lookup
services.
